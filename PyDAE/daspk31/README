DASPK 3.1
Large Scale Differential Algebraic Equation Solver with Sensitivity Analysis

Before using, dump the source files of the DASPK 3.1 solver folder into this folder.  
The fortran solver can be downloaded here: http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html
The files present should be as follows:
    adf_dummy.f
    daux.f
    ddaskr.f
    ddaspk.f
    dlinpk.f
    dsensd.f
    mpi_dummy.f

Making the PyDAS package will compile the fortran code as well as PyDAS wrappers.  
Use the 'make daspk31' command in the parent folder to compile the fortran code for
daspk31 only.
